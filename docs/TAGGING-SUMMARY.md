# Multi-Architecture Image Tagging Summary

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

### Images Tagged:
- ✅ **`wn1980/dev-box:amd64`** - AMD64/x86_64 architecture (3.48GB)
- ✅ **`wn1980/dev-box:arm64`** - ARM64/aarch64 architecture (3.33GB)  
- ✅ **`wn1980/dev-box:latest`** - Currently points to AMD64 (3.48GB)

### Source Images:
- `dev-box:latest-linux-amd64` → `wn1980/dev-box:amd64`
- `dev-box:latest-linux-arm64` → `wn1980/dev-box:arm64`

## Fixed Script: `scripts/tag-multiarch-images.sh`

### Key Improvements Made:
1. **Removed `set -e`** to handle errors gracefully
2. **Enhanced error handling** with better debugging output
3. **Added validation function** to verify tagged images
4. **Improved source image checking** with helpful error messages
5. **Added architecture and size verification**

### Script Features:
- ✅ Checks if source images exist before tagging
- ✅ Provides detailed progress output with colors
- ✅ Validates final results with architecture verification
- ✅ Supports `--dry-run` mode for testing
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- ✅ Shows helpful next-steps instructions

## Usage Examples:

### Run the tagging script:
```bash
./scripts/tag-multiarch-images.sh
```

### Test what would be tagged:
```bash
./scripts/tag-multiarch-images.sh --dry-run
```

### Get help:
```bash
./scripts/tag-multiarch-images.sh --help
```

## Next Steps (Optional):

### 1. Push to Docker Hub:
```bash
docker push wn1980/dev-box:amd64
docker push wn1980/dev-box:arm64
```

### 2. Create Multi-Architecture Manifest:
```bash
docker manifest create wn1980/dev-box:latest wn1980/dev-box:amd64 wn1980/dev-box:arm64
docker manifest push wn1980/dev-box:latest
```

### 3. Test Multi-Architecture Pulling:
```bash
# Auto-selects appropriate architecture
docker pull wn1980/dev-box:latest

# Force specific architecture  
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 wn1980/dev-box:amd64
docker pull --platform linux/arm64 wn1980/dev-box:arm64
```

## Script Validation:

The script now includes validation that checks:
- ✅ Image existence before tagging
- ✅ Successful tagging operation
- ✅ Final image architecture verification
- ✅ Image size reporting
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting

## Success Indicators:

When the script runs successfully, you'll see:
- Green checkmarks for successful operations
- Architecture verification (amd64/arm64)
- Image size information
- Clear instructions for next steps

The `tag-multiarch-images.sh` script is now robust and ready for production use!
