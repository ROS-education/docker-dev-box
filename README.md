# dev-box

A Dockerized development environment based on Ubuntu Noble, providing a complete SSH-accessible development environment managed by Supervisor. It comes pre-configured with Miniconda, essential C++/Python development tools, and is ready for remote development via SSH.



## ‚ú® Features

*   **Multi-Architecture Support:** Native support for both **AMD64** (x86_64) and **ARM64** (aarch64) architectures, including Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)
*   **SSH-Based Development:** Access a full development environment via SSH with VS Code Remote Development.
*   **Ubuntu Noble Base:** Built on the latest Ubuntu LTS release (at the time of writing).
*   **Miniconda:** Includes Miniconda for robust Python package and environment management.
*   **Pre-configured Conda Environment (`dev_env`):**
    *   Python 3.12
    *   Node.js 22
    *   CMake
    *   C++ Compiler (g++)
    *   Make
    *   GDB (GNU Debugger)

    *   `git` for version control.
    *   `clangd` for C/C++ language intelligence (installed via apt).
*   **Process Management:** Uses `supervisor` to manage SSH and other services reliably.
*   **Non-root User:** Runs development tasks as a standard user (`ubuntu`, UID/GID 1000) with passwordless `sudo` access.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Uses Docker volumes to persist user configuration and project files between container runs.
*   **SSH Access:** Secure SSH server running on port 2222 with both password and key-based authentication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

*   Docker Engine or Docker Desktop installed.
*   Git (optional, for cloning this repository).
*   Docker Compose (or the `docker compose` plugin).

## üåê Network Configuration

This container is configured to use **host networking** by default, providing direct access to the host's network stack. This means:

- **SSH Server**: Available directly on host port 2222
- **No port mapping needed**: Services bind to host ports directly
- **Better performance**: No network translation overhead

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The container SSH runs on port 2222 to avoid conflicts with host SSH. See [docs/HOST-NETWORK-SETUP.md](./docs/HOST-NETWORK-SETUP.md) for detailed configuration options and troubleshooting.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage (Running with Docker Compose)

This project includes a `docker-compose.yaml` file for easier management of the container and its volumes.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` (or the `docker compose` plugin) installed.
    *   Make sure the `Dockerfile`, the `app` directory, and the `docker-compose.yaml` file are in the same directory.

2.  **Build and Start the Container:**
    Open your terminal in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

    *   `docker-compose up`: Creates and starts the container(s) defined in the file.
    *   `-d`: Runs the container(s) in detached mode (in the background).
    *   `--build`: Forces Docker Compose to build the image using the `Dockerfile` before starting the service. You can omit `--build` on subsequent runs if the `Dockerfile` hasn't changed.

3.  **Access the development environment:**
    *   **SSH Access:** The container provides SSH access on port 2222:
      - `ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@localhost` (local)
      - `ssh -p 2222 ubuntu@<host-ip>` (remote)
      - Default password: `ubuntu` (‚ö†Ô∏è **Change this in production!**)

4.  **Working with Project Files:**
    The `docker-compose.yaml` file uses named volumes:
    *   `config`: Persists user settings and configurations from `/home/ubuntu/.config`.
    *   `conda`: Persists Conda environments and packages from `/home/ubuntu/.conda`.
    *   `Codespaces`: General workspace volume for projects.

    **Important:** This `docker-compose.yaml` uses *named volumes* managed by Docker. This means your project files are stored within Docker's internal storage area, not directly in a folder you specify on your host *by default*.

    *   **Option 1 (Recommended for new projects):** SSH into the container and use the terminal to clone repositories or create new projects directly within the `/workspace` directory. The data will be saved in the mounted volumes.
    *   **Option 2 (Using existing host projects - Modify Compose):** If you prefer to work directly with projects stored in a specific folder on your host machine (like `/path/on/your/host/to/projects`), modify the `volumes` section within the `dev-box` service in your `docker-compose.yaml` like this:

        ```yaml
        services:
          dev-box:
            # ... other settings ...
            volumes:
              - config:/home/ubuntu/.config
              - conda:/home/ubuntu/.conda
              - Codespaces:/workspace
              - /path/on/your/host/to/projects:/home/ubuntu/projects  # Add this bind mount
            # ... other settings ...
        ```
        **Remember to replace `/path/on/your/host/to/projects` with the actual path on your computer.** Then run `docker-compose up -d` again.

5.  **Using the Environment:**
    *   Once connected via SSH, you are in a full Ubuntu development environment running inside the container.
    *   Open a terminal session. You will be logged in as the `ubuntu` user, and the `dev_env` Conda environment will be activated automatically.
    *   You can use `git`, `python`, `g++`, `cmake`, `make`, `gdb`, `node`, etc., directly in the terminal.
    *   For a full IDE experience, use VS Code with the Remote-SSH extension to connect to the container.

6.  **Stopping the Container:**
    To stop the container(s) defined in the compose file:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    *(This stops and removes the container, but preserves the named volumes by default.)*

7.  **Stopping and Removing Volumes:**
    If you want to stop the container AND remove the named volumes (`config`, `projects`):
    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

8.  **Restarting the Container:**
    If the container is stopped, you can restart it with:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

9.  **Viewing Logs:**
    To view the logs from the running container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f dev-box
    ```
    (Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following logs).
